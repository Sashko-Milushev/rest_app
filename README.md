This is a free and open-source application for restaurants, bars and e.t.c.
The project is made by my self - Sashko Milushev. A former chef, with experience in restaurants for more than 12 years.
Now I am combining the acquirements from my present passion - software development and working in the professional kitchen.
This product is designed to help every component of the working environment in either a restaurant, bar or coffee.
